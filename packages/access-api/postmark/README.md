## Postmark templates

These are provided here for reference and version tracking.

Before use they must be manually configured in the Postmark account: 

1. In Postmark account, choose Server, then go to Templates tab: <https://account.postmarkapp.com/servers/${some_id}/templates>
2. Initial setup: add template if necessary, "Code your own" and your choice of existing/new or "Don't use a layout".
3. The name of the template is not critical, but the "Alias" configuration link must be set to match the file name(s) in this directory. The subject should be set if provided here.
4. There are two tabs in Postmark's editor, copy-paste both the HTML and Text versions for a given template.

Please make sure to keep the files here up-to-date with any edits you might make from the Postmark dashboard.
