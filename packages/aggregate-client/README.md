### `InvocationConfig`

This is the configuration for the UCAN invocation. It is an object with `issuer`, `audience`, `resource` and `proofs`:

- The `issuer` is the signing authority that is issuing the UCAN invocation(s).
- The `audience` is the principal authority that the UCAN is delegated to.
- The `resource` (`with` field) points to a storage space.
- The `proofs` are a set of capability delegations that prove the issuer has the capability to perform the action. These might not be required.
