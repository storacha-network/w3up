 * It is recommended to provide an optional list of shard links that contain
 * fragments of this DAG, as it allows system to optimize block discovery, it is
 * also a way to communicate DAG partiality - this upload contains partial DAG
 * identified by the given `root`.
 *
 * Usually when agent wants to upload a DAG it will encode it as a one or more
 * CAR files (shards) and invoke `store/add` capability for each one. Once all
 * shards are stored it will invoke `upload/add` capability (providing link to
 * a DAG root and all the shards) to add it the upload list.
 *
 * That said `upload/add` could be invoked without invoking `store/add`s e.g.
 * because another (memory) space may already have those CARs.
 *
 * Note: If DAG with the given root is already in the upload list, invocation
 * will simply update `shards` to be a union of existing and new shards.
